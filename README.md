# Requirements

- neovim v0.10
- git (for lazy.nvim)
- npm (for the typescript LS) - I chose to install NVM and then run `nvm install node` then `nvm use x.x.x` which will then enable a node version along with it's relevant npm
- A C compiler - I installed [mingw](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/mingw)
- ripgrep (for telescopes grep commands)
